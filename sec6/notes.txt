    git branch : tells me what branch im on
    the one thats active has * next to it

L45. Creating Branches
    q tp exit git log
    git branch <branch-name> : creates a branch
    this makes the branch but does not switch to the branch for me
    git switch <branch-name> : switch to a branch

    I can not see the message in this file that is on the first-branch

    It does matter where I branch from

L47. Another Option: Git Checkout Vs. Git Switch
    git checkout <branch-name> : acts just like switch
